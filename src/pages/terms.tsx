            This acceptable use policy (“Policy”) sets forth the general
            guidelines and acceptable and prohibited uses of the “Spalhe” mobile
            application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its
            related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This
            Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or
            “your”) and this Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”,
            “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of
            a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
            authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
            terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do
            not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of

            you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not
            physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile
            Application and Services. Prohibited activities and uses You may not
            use the Mobile Application and Services to publish content or engage

            the transmission, distribution or delivery of any bulk e-mail,
            including unsolicited bulk or unsolicited commercial e-mail, or the
            sending, assisting, or commissioning the transmission of commercial
            e-mail that does not comply with the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003
            (“SPAM”). Your products or services advertised via SPAM (i.e.
            Spamvertised) may not be used in conjunction with the Mobile
            Application and Services. This provision includes, but is not
            limited to, SPAM sent via fax, phone, postal mail, email, instant
            messaging, or newsgroups. Defamation and objectionable content We
            value the freedom of expression and encourage Users to be respectful
            with the content they post. We are not a publisher of User content
            and are not in a position to investigate the veracity of individual
            defamation claims or to determine whether certain material, which we
            may find objectionable, should be censored. However, we reserve the
            right to moderate, disable or remove any content to prevent harm to
            others or to us or the Mobile Application and Services, as
            determined in our sole discretion. Copyrighted content Copyrighted
            material must not be published via the Mobile Application and
            Services without the explicit permission of the copyright owner or a
            person explicitly authorized to give such permission by the
            copyright owner. Upon receipt of a claim for copyright infringement,
            or a notice of such violation, we will immediately run full
            investigation. However, we generally require a court order from a
            court of competent jurisdiction, as determined by us in our sole
            discretion, to take down alleged infringing material from the Mobile
            Application and Services. We may terminate the Service of Users with
            repeated copyright infringements. Further procedures may be carried
            out if necessary. We will assume no liability to any User of the
            Mobile Application and Services for the removal of any such
            material. If you believe your copyright is being infringed by a
            person or persons using the Mobile Application and Services, please
            get in touch with us to report copyright infringement. Security You
            take full responsibility for maintaining reasonable security
            precautions for your account. You are responsible for protecting and
            updating any login account provided to you for the Mobile
            Application and Services. You must protect the confidentiality of
            your login details, and you should change your password
            periodically. Enforcement We reserve our right to be the sole
            arbiter in determining the seriousness of each infringement and to
            immediately take corrective actions, including but not limited to: -
            Suspending or terminating your Service with or without notice upon
            any violation of this Policy. Any violations may also result in the
            immediate suspension or termination of your account. - Disabling or
            removing any content which is prohibited by this Policy, including
            to prevent harm to others or to us or the Mobile Application and
            Services, as determined by us in our sole discretion. - Reporting
            violations to law enforcement as determined by us in our sole
            discretion. - A failure to respond to an email from our abuse team
            within 2 days, or as otherwise specified in the communication to
            you, may result in the suspension or termination of your account.
            Suspended and terminated User accounts due to violations will not be
            re-activated. Nothing contained in this Policy shall be construed to
            limit our actions or remedies in any way with respect to any of the
            prohibited activities. In addition, we reserve at all times all
            rights and remedies available to us with respect to such activities
            at law or in equity. Reporting violations If you have discovered and
            would like to report a violation of this Policy, please contact us
            immediately. We will investigate the situation and provide you with
            full assistance. Changes and amendments We reserve the right to
            modify this Policy or its terms related to the Mobile Application
            and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will

            provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as

            version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the
            posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your
            continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after the
            effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at
            that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. Acceptance
